problem,prompt,explanation
garden_no_repetition,"Calculate and print the amount of plants, fill and soil needed in different parts of a garden with a specific geometric layout.","Computing the area of a circle is used in computing plants, fill and soil, so we separate it out as its own function. "
garden_repetition,"Calculate and print the amount of plants, fill and soil needed in different parts of a garden with a specific geometric layout.","Computing the number of plants in a circle and a semicircle is similar, the only difference being the area that is use. Thus, computing the number of plants can be separated as a function with one parameter representing the size of the area."
rose,Draw a rose using ASCII characters.,"The principle of single responsability can be applied to separate the different components of the program into different functions with specific funtionality, for example, drawing the rose bud and the stem."
count_min_inclusion,Count how many times the minimum value appears in a list.,The code pattern of finding the minimum includes the element counting pattern. The two patterns can be separated and sequenced because the counting of the minimum only needs to be done once the minimum has been found.
count_min_concatenated,Count how many times the minimum value appears in a list.,The code patterns (counting and finding the minimum) are concatenated and may be separated into different functions.
count_min_interleaved,Count how many times the minimum value appears in a list.,"The code either identifies a new minimum or counts the minimum (established at a previous step) with each iteration of the loop. While this solution may be the most algorithmically optimal, may be harder to debug and maintain. Separating out the finding of the minimum and its counting simplifies the complexity of the code."
fish,Draw a fish of different sizes using ASCII characters.,There is a linear relation between the statements for drawing a smaller and a bigger fish which can be exploited to collapese the duplicate function into one.
cubes,Compute and print how many cubes can fit in a container with sizes specified by the user.,The reading and computation of the fit of cubes on each of the three dimensions is similar and can be collapsed to one function. Note that for this problem the order of the printing is not important.
flowers,Draw different flowers using ASCII characters.,The components of the flowers (buds and stems) can be mixed and matched and therefore they can be isolated in different functions that are then combined to draw different flowers.
guitars,Draw different style guitars using ASCII characters.,The components of the guitars can be mixed and matched and therefore they can be isolated in different functions that are then combined to draw different guitars.
old_macdonald,Print the lyrics of the song Old MacDonald.,The same lyrics are repeated three times with the only differences being the animals and the sounds the animals make. The components that are different can be pased in as parameters to a verse function.
elephants,Print the lyrics of the song Elephants.,The same lyrics are repeated three times with the only difference being in the number of elephants. The number of elephants can be pased in as parameters to a verse function.
